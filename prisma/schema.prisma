// This conversation relationship is a one-to-many relationship. It tells Prisma that a user can have many conversations. The fields: [conversationIds] tells Prisma that the conversationIds field in the user model is related to the id field in the conversation model. The references: [id] tells Prisma that the id field in the conversation model is related to the conversationIds field in the user model. This is necessary because Prisma needs to know how to relate the two models.

// This message relationship is a one-to-many relationship. It tells Prisma that a user can have many messages. The fields: [messageIds] tells Prisma that the messageIds field in the user model is related to the id field in the message model. The references: [id] tells Prisma that the id field in the message model is related to the messageIds field in the user model. This is necessary because Prisma needs to know how to relate the two models.

The onDelete: Cascade tells Prisma that if a user is deleted, then all of the accounts that are related to that user should also be deleted.
